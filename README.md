## StyleTransfer
Style transfer is a technique where we use two images 
- Content image which is the main content of the image
- Style image which could be termed as the layout of the image, something like a color scale in simplest of the terms

What style transfer does is that it takes the content of the content image and the style of the style image and merges them up to create an new image that resembles the content of the content image and the style of the style image
